          <h1>The ‘silent witness’ Birbal trap</h1>
          <p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            Fraud encompasses a wide range of wrongdoings such as theft, embezzlement, larceny, pilferage, corrupt practices, and accounting manipulations. All the foregoing are wrongdoings which are detrimental to a company financially. However there are also other kinds of wrongdoings which adversely affect a company as regards its goodwill, its image and its reputation. These include money laundering, corporate espionage, identity frauds, and  sexual abuse which have swelled to  massive proportions in the last decade. Corporate management needs to provide measures for prevention and deterrence and where any such case has been reported, such a case needs to be investigated and reported to the appropriate authorities. The following is one case study relating to sexual abuse,  through a malicious  letter sent to a lady employee in a branch office.

          <p><h4>Facts of the case</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            There was a branch office of a company which had a majority of male employees. One day a lady accounts officer received a nasty abusive letter on her desk. The unsigned letter had been placed on her desk before she came to the office in the morning. The lady was naturally depressed. Initially she kept it to herself, but eventually she mustered up the courage to report this to the manager. In turn, the manager reported this to the senior director. The matter had reached the highest level and the director felt that this could not be tolerated. However he did not wish to turn the matter over to the police either.  He therefore checked with his internal auditor, who was his ‘Birbal’,  to advise him and if possible to  investigate into the matter himself.

          <p><h4>The internal auditor’s recommendation</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            The internal auditor decided to get all the possible details relating to this case. He therefore set up an inquiry. Based on swipe card entries of people entering and leaving the office, the internal auditor found that there were ten possible suspects who could have placed the letter on the lady’s desk. He questioned each of them and even scanned all their laptops and desktop computers to determine whether they could have done this;  as expected, they all denied having written such a letter. Eight of the ten suspects did not think that anyone from the office could have done this. Based on the responses received from these eight suspects, some other circumstantial evidence, the view of the aggrieved lady herself, and his own judgment, the  auditor  didn’t think that any of these eight could have been responsible for that letter.  However the two remaining suspects seemed to be very likely to have written this letter. The reasons for both of them to be considered strong suspects were plenty. Both were fond of pornographic material as was revealed by a search of their computer hard disk drives. Both did not get along well with that lady assistant. Most importantly both did not subscribe to the view that this letter could not have been written by anyone from the office- in fact both blamed each other for having written this letter, but for different reasons. The first, A, blamed the second B, on the basis that the words and language used in the letter were those frequently used by B,  which was found to be true, as per inquiries made by the auditor. B blamed the first by stating that just the day before the letter A had cracked a very dirty joke about the lady in front of many others and moreover the contents of the letter closely resembled the subject matter of that joke. The internal auditor checked this out and it was found that even that was true. Thus either A or B could have done this, and even the aggrieved lady agreed with the auditor. She confirmed that there were many occasions where she had felt uncomfortable with these two suspects who regularly used abusive language in office and they particularly did not like working under her because she was senior to them.   
            The question was: who, out of these two, could have written this letter? The internal auditor was mulling over this at home and he suddenly got the answer from his son, who narrated to him a Birbal story based on an episode on recently telecast on TV. On hearing that Birbal story, the internal auditor thought of an idea to expose the guilty one.

          <p><h4>The Birbal silent ‘witness’ trap which inspired the auditor</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            The anecdote which inspired the auditor was as follows. Once Birbal had been put in a very difficult situation of identifying a culprit from among two suspected thieves in a guest house. Each suspect blamed the other of theft. What had happened was something like this. One night, when both these suspects were staying at that guest house, one of them stole some valuables and was stealthily making his way out. However the other guest, who was sleeping nearby, heard the sound and came out. He saw this thief trying to escape and immediately sprang on him to stop him. A fight broke out and in all this commotion, all the other guests and the staff of the guesthouse woke up and gathered there. The thief thought quickly and before anyone even asked, he put the entire  blame on the other guest. He reversed the reality by stating that he had heard the other guest trying to escape after stealing some valuables and therefore had stopped him which resulted into the scuffle. The other guest was shocked but defended himself by saying that the reality was exactly the opposite and it was he who had tried to stop the other from escaping. Thus both blamed each other for the crime, in much  the same situation as the auditor found himself in the above case study. How did Birbal find out the truth? Birbal set up a ‘silent witness’ trap to expose the real thief. As per Birbal’s plan both the suspects were to go with him to the garden nearby ostensibly to understand and discuss the matter with Birbal peacefully. However when they reached there, they found a dead body of a young man who had apparently fallen from a tree. Seeing this body, Birbal covered him with a cloth and asked the suspects to take the body to the palace while he would go and inform the dead man’s parents. Birbal promised them that he would join them immediately thereafter, at the palace. While the two suspects were carrying the body, they started talking with each other. The innocent person  accused  the other person of being the thief and untruthful. He started crying and regretted that he was caught in this matter though he was not at fault. Because the two of them were alone, with only the dead body near them, the thief did not deny this and in fact, told the other that had he  minded his own business this would not have happened. He should not have  interfered by trying to stop him from escaping.  He spitefully told him that he deserved this fate and now, no one would ever know the truth. But the thief was wrong. That dead body  was actually a ‘silent’ witness, a part of  Birbal’s trap. The man was not dead; he was very much alive and he heard all this conversation which he  narrated to Birbal and the real thief was exposed and eventually punished.

            This ‘silent witness’ was a very simple but effective way of exposing a wrongdoer who tried to pin the blame on someone else. There was nothing magical about this trap but it was very imaginative and got the desired results. This Birbal ‘silent witness’ trap was applied with success in the case study above.

          <p><h4>The internal auditor sets up the silent witness trap</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            The internal auditor asked both these suspects A and B to meet him in the conference room together. He told them that the situation was serious, and  if  he could not identify  the culprit soon,  the director would certainly dismiss both of them. He mentioned that they were lucky that the lady was not going to report this matter to the police. While he was talking to them, a peon came in the conference with  a message from the director. The message was a request from the director asking the auditor  to meet him on a matter of great importance immediately, for a few minutes. Accordingly the auditor excused himself to go and meet the director. However, he told the two suspects A and B to wait there till he returned. As he had expected, while the two  were alone in the conference room, some conversation would take place. It did. A turned around to B and accused him of writing the letter. B who was indeed the culprit, knowing that they were alone in the conference room, did not bother to deny it. In fact, B was so overconfident that he even revealed that he already had got a new job. B further stated that he was glad to get out of this company and he was tired of working under that ‘stupid lady’. He openly admitted that he had indeed written that letter and if he got a chance, he would even do it again. His vindictive and malicious attitude towards her was completely exposed then because he let out a lot of abusive words against her. He even started boasting of other such abusive things he had done and said that no one could catch him. On hearing all this A was even more depressed because he was co-branded as a culprit with such a person. However his troubles were over. Soon thereafter, the internal auditor came back and after asking them  a few more questions, he terminated this meeting. He checked his ‘silent witness’-   his mobile cell phone. This  mobile cell phone, which he had deliberately left back in the conference room had a  recording device which was left on. Thus, the mobile phone had recorded the entire conversation between A and B during his absence. B was exposed and confronted and he had no choice but to confess. He was then dismissed from duty

          <p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            This use of the recording device was actually a simple solution, but the way in which it was used was imaginative. In modern times we have far more sophisticated tools and techniques yet we often come up with poor results. Why? Because we don’t use the technology intelligently and adapt it to given situations. In the foregoing case, getting the suspects together,  making them talk, putting them at ease thinking that they were alone, and also threatening them with punishment were all simple steps, but the results were phenomenal. These steps led  them to discuss this matter freely. These Birbal tricks and traps are nothing but common sense methods used in given situations with the right timing and careful planning. These traps could be useful in adapting modern technology to accomplish given objectives in almost every situation.
