          <h1>The ‘time-bomb’ approach used by fraudsters- Part I</h1>
          <p><h4>Fraud- an evil which stems from intellectually strong minded people</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            As compared with most other wrongdoings like theft, burglary, dacoity, and pilferage, fraud is committed by wrongdoers who are intelligent. Fraud by such intelligent wrongdoers is not a simple act of deception and seizure of opportunity, but an act (or omission) which is executed with great planning and with full anticipation and preparation to face the after effects and consequences to follow. Such fraudsters take adequate steps to ensure that their acts or omissions are camouflaged to prevent detection. Among the many such methods and techniques used by fraudsters, the time bomb technique is the  most devastating. This article illustrates, in two parts, this method using illustrations in two different situations: one in a hospital by a shrewd surgeon to get rid of his competition and one in a five star hotel by an intelligent systems administrator to suppress  hotel  collections.

          <p><h4>What is this time bomb approach?</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            Everyone knows the meaning of a time bomb. It is a bomb which does not explode immediately on being activated but one which explodes after a certain time. This enables the  person setting the bomb to have time to escape to safety. Thus, in a time bomb the most important element is that the damage can be postponed for a certain time to enable the bomber to escape or to make the bomb explode at a time when an event is expected to happen. This time bomb approach is used by intelligent white collar criminals in other activities in almost any kind of business  for perpetrating fraud. Very simply, they carry out an act/omission which does not impede or affect any routine operation for some time. The act/omission remains latent and unnoticed for some time before it activates a devastating action. This period of time when it remains dormant or latent enables the perpetrator to distance himself from the scene and virtually rules out any suspicion falling on him. However he benefits from the devastation in some way. The following is one such example of a time bomb fraud  in a very reputed and leading hospital.

          <p><h4>Case Study of a time bomb fraud in a hospital</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            There were two well known heart surgeons A and B. Both were brilliant and reputed in their field. Both of them  had been working for several years in the hospital and they had been friends as well as competitors. The position of  the dean in that hospital was going to be vacated in a few days. It was certain that either A or B would be given the position. It was going to be a difficult choice since both were good and both deserved that position. B,  being a little senior in age stood a better chance, though in terms of brilliance, A had the edge. Becoming the dean was important not only for the improved pay and position but also because it was the best hospital in the country and entailed a lot of foreign delegations, luxurious privileges and regular newspaper, television and media coverage. Naturally both A and B were keen on getting selected but unfortunately only one of them could get promoted. 

            It so happened that B had a sudden heart problem himself and after a lot of medical tests, it was found that he had to have one of the valves in the heart changed and that he would have to undergo surgery. The hospital authorities decided that A was the best surgeon to do it and therefore the task of operating was assigned to A. A accordingly made arrangements to do the operation. His team for this operation included other junior doctors and a matron who had been working in the hospital for a long time and who knew both A and B very closely. The matron was very unhappy to learn that A had been given the task of operating on B, because she suspected that A might deliberately do something wrong in the surgery so that B would be injured or harmed or incapacitated, to ensure that B could not get promoted as the dean.  She was so worried that she didn’t rule out the possibility that A might even do something to make B  die during the surgery. 
            She did not have the courage  voice her concerns to  the hospital authorities,  because she felt that  they would not pay attention to her. Apart from being such an intelligent, reputed and well known surgeon,  A was a colleague and an old friend of B. Further, she reassured herself, that in A’s own interest, he would do nothing which would mar his reputation as a surgeon. Thus the operation went ahead as scheduled. During  the operation, the matron noticed that A was very nervous and she feared that her suspicions would come true and B would die. However to her surprise and happiness,  the surgery was successful. B was wheeled out of the operating theater alive and well.

          <p><h4>The matron investigates-The matter of absorbable ‘sutures’ </h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            The matron was relieved. However while she was leaving the operation theatre after B’s surgery, she saw some  ‘sutures’ ( sutures are threads used by doctors for stitching wounds in a patient’s body) lying on the floor. Having worked  for years in the hospital she felt that there was something wrong about these sutures. She went to another doctor who examined these sutures and told her that these were ‘dissolvable’ or absorbable temporary  sutures. On discussing the matter further with that doctor, she learnt something  that shocked her. Dissolvable sutures were never used in that type of heart surgery. Only permanent sutures had to be used in such a major surgery in the heart so that they would keep the valve tightly bound permanently. There are two types of sutures: those that are permanent and those that are dissolvable. Dissolvable sutures were not used in that kind of heart surgery because they would dissolve in the body after a few days. Since such sutures dissolve very quickly,  the binding effect would be lost and eventually result in malfunction  in the heart.  The heart would then be incapable of pumping blood and the patient would die. Therefore non –dissolvable or nonabsorbable sutures  are essential for internal heart surgeries because  they need to hold the tissue  for a prolonged time. Such nonabsorbable sutures either are permanent or deteriorate very slowly. They hold their strength for at least 300 days or longer.

          <p><h4>The Matron exposes the time bomb fraud of A</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            A had deliberately used dissolvable sutures which would work perfectly for some time and produce the desired binding effect for B and enable B to pass all medical tests. Thus after the operation it would look as though the surgery was successful and  B  came out alive and well from the operating theater. A got credit for doing  the surgery well though in reality, A had planted a kind of time bomb in B’s heart using dissolvable sutures. A made certain that B would die after a few days when the sutures would dissolve, but at that time it would look like an unforeseen heart attack. This time delay of B’s death would allow A to get away without being implicated in B’s death.. The dissolvable sutures were like a time bomb ticking in B’s body and as soon as they got dissolved, B would die and A would be the automatic choice to be selected as the dean. This time
            the matron informed  the hospital authorities about the discovery of sutures. She got a quick response as  the head of the department  immediately realized the seriousness of this matter.  B was operated immediately again this time by an independent surgeon. This time the correct permanent sutures were used. Some of the earlier sutures were recovered and it was proved that A had indeed attempted to murder B by using this ‘time bomb’ approach.

          <p><h4>Time bomb approach is used even in business fraud.</h4></p>
          <p class="articletext">
            It is indeed sad that, in life, a human being can do such evil wicked acts. The above principle of the time bomb is similarly  easily used even in book-keeping, accounting and day to day business practices to commit fraud and deceive others. In the world of business, particular IT and computer environment, the terms ‘logic bomb’ and ‘slag code’ are not unusual. In a computer program, slag code or a logic bomb is a programming code, inserted surreptitiously but intentionally, to execute or "explode" after lapse of a certain amount of time or the happening of a particular event. It is, in effect a delayed-action computer virus which can lead to unimaginable disaster. The next part of this article will illustrate how this approach was used by a systems administrator in a five star hotel for personal enrichment.
