Our belief in this thought-process is the central theme of the Course that facilitate participants in improvising their ‘Thinking Different’ abilities. In the world of forensics, there is no standard craft to detect and investigate fraud and therefore we believe that each one must constantly evolve by reinventing the three ‘a’s -  adapt, adept and augment innovative ideas. This is possible only if a person sheds his fallacious filters that he has woven himself into, for which he needs to be drawn into an open environment that enables stretching his imagination. The best way to ‘learn’ is therefore to ride on other’s experiences in a way that not only hones learner’s skills but also retains the ownership of acquisition. We therefore assert that case studies are excellent way to learn and the best experiential learning emanates from accomplishments acquired from outside the mundane routines. With this philosophy, we bring live case studies from diverse domains that enable users to share and learn from introspection and intra-spection. We only share our experiences amassed over the last more than 25+ years. </div>

                                <div class="accordion-inner"> Today frauds and white-collar crimes are corroding the profits, assets and businesses of many organisations. In some cases, the menace has even completely eroded the organisations and reduce them to ashes. Crimes are observed in the best of the orgainsations, even with superlative people, state-of-art computers /systems,  with robust preventive mechanisms and well defined operating procedures and system. Therefore, regulators world over are making the statute more stringent and casting responsibilities on management and others who need to safeguard and protect the interest of various stakeholders. These evils cannot be completely eliminated but can only be kept under check and minimised to a greater extent. Experts say that education and training or just awareness of the frauds itself will make many people effective to combat frauds and thus save large amounts of losses. Thus, this course will increase your chances to understand and arrest the frauds at an early stage and help the organisations to increase profitability, reduce losses and/or complying with local laws. Needless to say, that you stand a better chance to elevate yourself in the corporate ladder or increase your chances with new employments or be effective in your work. So whether you are just graduate and looking for that first job or a junior executive looking for quantum jump in corporate hierarchy or an very experience manager who may be responsible for the work of his juniors or C-level key managerial person, all will benefit from the case studies and awareness about the evils in society. Hence this course will immensely benefit not only the auditors but also all other managers who may be in non-accountancy profession too.</div>
